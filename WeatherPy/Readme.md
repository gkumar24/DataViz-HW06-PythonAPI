# Home Work Assignment - PythonAPI - Final Report

## Assignment Scope

* To answer the basic "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" with facts and figures.
* To analyze 500+ random cities accross the world. spread accross different geography. 
* Generate 500+ cities, using citipy library. which gives city based on latitude and longitude.
* divide Latitude and Longitude equally, so as to get enough number of points, return 500+ cities. 
* Analyse the Maximum Temperature of the city at the moment of recording, 
* based on the latitude, explain if the temperature increase or decrease, going towards the Equator (Latitude of 0 Degree).
* Also analyze the Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed, and plot with details. 

## Synonyms
* Tumor: A tumor is a mass of tissue that's formed by an accumulation of abnormal cells.
* Cancer: A disease in which abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and destroy body tissue.
* Metastasis: In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed (primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph system, and form new tumors (metastatic tumors) in other parts of the body.
* Latitude - South: -90 degree to North: +90 degree, with 0 degree being the Equator, South 23.4 being the Tropic of Capricon, and North 23.4 being the Tropic of Cancer.
* Longitude - West: -180 Degree to East: 180 Degree

## Complete Jupyter Notebook Code

### 1. Temperature Vs Latitude
* Plot the recorded temperature for the cities, based on the latitude of the cities.
* Observe if the temperature increase or decrease while going towards Equator i.e. Latitude of 0 degree.

### 2. Humidity vs Latitude
* Plot Humidity (in %) recorded in each of the cities based on Latitude. 
* Is there any observation, that can be done from humidity vs latitude

### 3. Cloudiness vs Latitude
* Plot Cloudiness recorded in each of the cities based on Latitude. 
* Is there any observation, that can be done from Cloudiness vs latitude

### 4. Wind speed vs Latitude
* Plot Wind Speed(in Miles per Hour) recorded in each of the cities based on Latitude. 
* Is there any observation, that can be done from Wind speed vs latitude

## Observation
Based on the data Analysis, below are the observation / findings.
